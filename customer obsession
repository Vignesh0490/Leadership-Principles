Customer Obsession

Situation:
As a Seller Partner Support representative at Amazon, I recently received a distressing complaint from a UK seller. The issue at hand was a significant obstacle to their sales in France. Customers attempting to place orders above 150 Euros were consistently encountering an error, severely impacting the seller's revenue and market performance.

Task:
My task was to conduct a thorough investigation into the reported error, understanding the specific details of the problem, and collaborating with relevant teams to find a resolution. The primary goal was to ensure a seamless experience for customers in France and, subsequently, improve the sales performance of the UK seller.

Action:

Investigation: I immediately initiated an in-depth investigation, working closely with our technical support team. For instance, we scrutinized order data, transaction logs, and system glitches that might contribute to the issue. This meticulous analysis was crucial in identifying the root cause.

Collaboration with Internal Teams: Recognizing the complexity of the issue, I collaborated with cross-functional teams, including engineering, product management, and customer support. For instance, I facilitated regular meetings to discuss findings, share insights, and collectively develop a comprehensive solution.

Communication with the Seller: Throughout the process, I maintained open and transparent communication with the UK seller. I provided real-time updates on the progress of the investigation, explained the steps being taken to resolve the issue, and assured them that their concerns were a top priority.

Temporary Workaround: Understanding the urgency of the situation for the seller, I proposed and implemented a temporary workaround. For example, we provided the UK seller with a set of clear instructions to communicate directly with their customers in France. This involved instructing customers to split their orders into smaller amounts, ensuring each order was below the 150 Euro threshold. This temporary measure allowed the seller to continue making sales while we worked on a permanent fix.

Result:
The collaborative efforts led to the identification and resolution of the issue causing errors for French customers placing orders exceeding 150 Euros. By implementing a temporary workaround and communicating proactively with the UK seller, we were able to minimize the impact on their sales while working on a permanent fix. The positive resolution not only addressed the immediate concerns of the seller but also demonstrated our commitment to customer obsession and improving the overall customer experience on the platform.

Situation:
I encountered a scenario where a seller was encountering challenges while trying to create new products in their seller account. The frustration was evident, indicating a potential breakdown in the support they had received thus far. This situation had the potential to hinder the seller's ability to list and sell products effectively on the platform.

Task:
My task was to address the seller's concerns, understand the specific challenges they were facing in creating new products, and ensure a positive resolution. The primary focus was on aligning with the Customer Obsession leadership principle, prioritizing the seller's needs and providing a solution that enhances their experience on the platform.

Action:

Active Listening and Empathy: I began by actively listening to the seller's concerns, acknowledging their frustration, and expressing empathy. This involved seeking detailed information about the challenges they encountered during the product creation process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

Detailed Investigation: To pinpoint the root cause of the challenges, I conducted a detailed investigation into the seller's account, examining the steps they had taken and identifying any potential technical glitches or system errors. This step was crucial in ensuring a precise and targeted resolution.

Transparent Communication: I maintained transparent communication with the seller throughout the process. This involved providing regular updates on the status of the investigation, explaining any findings or potential reasons for the challenges, and setting clear expectations for the resolution timeline.

Collaboration with Technical Support: Recognizing that resolving technical issues might require specialized expertise, I collaborated closely with the technical support team. This collaboration aimed to expedite the resolution process by leveraging the necessary technical insights and resources.

Proactive Solutions and Follow-Up: As a proactive measure, I proposed interim solutions or workarounds that the seller could use while the investigation was ongoing. This ensured that their ability to create and list new products was not completely hindered during the resolution period. Additionally, I committed to regular follow-ups to track progress and gather feedback.

Result:
Through active listening, detailed investigation, transparent communication, collaboration with technical support, and proactive solutions, we successfully addressed the seller's challenges in creating new products. The positive resolution not only alleviated their frustration but also reinforced our commitment to the Customer Obsession leadership principle, placing the seller's needs at the forefront of our support efforts. The ongoing follow-up ensured that the seller felt supported and valued throughout the resolution process.
