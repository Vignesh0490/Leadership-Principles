Customer Obsession

Situation:
As a Seller Partner Support representative at Amazon, I recently received a distressing complaint from a UK seller. The issue at hand was a significant obstacle to their sales in France. Customers attempting to place orders above 150 Euros were consistently encountering an error, severely impacting the seller's revenue and market performance.

Task:
My task was to conduct a thorough investigation into the reported error, understanding the specific details of the problem, and collaborating with relevant teams to find a resolution. The primary goal was to ensure a seamless experience for customers in France and, subsequently, improve the sales performance of the UK seller.

Action:

Investigation: I immediately initiated an in-depth investigation, working closely with our technical support team. For instance, we scrutinized order data, transaction logs, and system glitches that might contribute to the issue. This meticulous analysis was crucial in identifying the root cause.

Collaboration with Internal Teams: Recognizing the complexity of the issue, I collaborated with cross-functional teams, including engineering, product management, and customer support. For instance, I facilitated regular meetings to discuss findings, share insights, and collectively develop a comprehensive solution.

Communication with the Seller: Throughout the process, I maintained open and transparent communication with the UK seller. I provided real-time updates on the progress of the investigation, explained the steps being taken to resolve the issue, and assured them that their concerns were a top priority.

Temporary Workaround: Understanding the urgency of the situation for the seller, I proposed and implemented a temporary workaround. For example, we provided the UK seller with a set of clear instructions to communicate directly with their customers in France. This involved instructing customers to split their orders into smaller amounts, ensuring each order was below the 150 Euro threshold. This temporary measure allowed the seller to continue making sales while we worked on a permanent fix.

Result:
The collaborative efforts led to the identification and resolution of the issue causing errors for French customers placing orders exceeding 150 Euros. By implementing a temporary workaround and communicating proactively with the UK seller, we were able to minimize the impact on their sales while working on a permanent fix. The positive resolution not only addressed the immediate concerns of the seller but also demonstrated our commitment to customer obsession and improving the overall customer experience on the platform.
