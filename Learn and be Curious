Situation:
While working in seller support at Amazon, I encountered a challenge where sellers were unable to upload images despite being in the correct format. This issue wasn't covered in our standard operating procedures (SOP), and the images were not flowing internally through the system.

Task:
Realizing the need to find a solution, I proactively took the initiative to explore potential resolutions. I initially searched through our internal wiki pages but couldn't find any relevant steps to address the issue. Recognizing the need for further investigation, I decided to reach out to the subject matter expert (SME) team for assistance.

Action:
I scheduled meetings with the SME team to discuss the problem and explore possible solutions. During these discussions, I acknowledged the frustration faced by sellers due to the image upload issue. Understanding the urgency, I reassured the sellers, asking for their patience while we worked on a resolution.

As part of addressing the problem, I learned about a tool that could potentially help resolve the image upload issue. However, I was uncertain about how to use the tool effectively. To bridge this knowledge gap, I demonstrated the "Learn and Be Curious" principle by seeking additional information. I reached out to the SME team to request documentation or guidance on how to use the tool properly. Through collaborative efforts, we set up calls, and they provided me with detailed documentation on the tool's functionality and step-by-step instructions on its usage.

Result:
Armed with this newfound knowledge, I applied the instructions and successfully resolved the issue with image uploads for sellers. The images started flowing internally as expected, and sellers were able to use the platform without disruptions.

This experience showcased my commitment to the "Learn and Be Curious" principle by actively seeking solutions beyond the existing SOP, acknowledging and addressing seller frustration, engaging with experts, and taking the initiative to understand and apply a new tool to benefit both sellers and the internal system.
