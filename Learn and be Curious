Situation:
While working in seller support at Amazon, I encountered a challenge where sellers were unable to upload images despite being in the correct format. This issue wasn't covered in our standard operating procedures (SOP), and the images were not flowing internally through the system.

Task:
Realizing the need to find a solution, I proactively took the initiative to explore potential resolutions. I initially searched through our internal wiki pages but couldn't find any relevant steps to address the issue. Recognizing the need for further investigation, I decided to reach out to the subject matter expert (SME) team for assistance.

Action:
I scheduled meetings with the SME team to discuss the problem and explore possible solutions. During these discussions, I acknowledged the frustration faced by sellers due to the image upload issue. Understanding the urgency, I reassured the sellers, asking for their patience while we worked on a resolution.

As part of addressing the problem, I learned about a tool that could potentially help resolve the image upload issue. However, I was uncertain about how to use the tool effectively. To bridge this knowledge gap, I demonstrated the "Learn and Be Curious" principle by seeking additional information. I reached out to the SME team to request documentation or guidance on how to use the tool properly. Through collaborative efforts, we set up calls, and they provided me with detailed documentation on the tool's functionality and step-by-step instructions on its usage.

Result:
Armed with this newfound knowledge, I applied the instructions and successfully resolved the issue with image uploads for sellers. The images started flowing internally as expected, and sellers were able to use the platform without disruptions.

This experience showcased my commitment to the "Learn and Be Curious" principle by actively seeking solutions beyond the existing SOP, acknowledging and addressing seller frustration, engaging with experts, and taking the initiative to understand and apply a new tool to benefit both sellers and the internal system.

Situation:
As a seller support professional at Amazon, I received a report from a seller stating that they were encountering difficulties in creating bulk products using a specific template for a particular category. One identified issue was that certain categories had unique attributes that were not correctly represented in the template, leading to errors during the bulk product creation process.

Task:
Recognizing the complexity of the issue, I took the initiative to delve into the details. The seller highlighted that the problem was specifically tied to the use of a template in a designated category, adding an additional layer of intricacy. I acknowledged the seller's concern promptly and assured them that I would work diligently to understand and resolve the problem. It was clear that this situation required a deeper level of understanding beyond standard support procedures.

Action:
To address the challenge, I proactively embraced the "Learn and Be Curious" principle. I began by thoroughly reviewing the seller's account and attempted to replicate the issue in a controlled environment, using the specified template within the particular category. This approach helped me pinpoint the unique circumstances contributing to the problem.

Acknowledging the need for additional insights, I reached out to a subject matter expert (SME) within the team who had expertise in template-based product creation and the specific category in question. This expert provided valuable context and insights, offering a deeper understanding of the potential causes and solutions.

Understanding the importance of gathering diverse perspectives, I initiated discussions with colleagues and sought input from other teams that might have encountered similar challenges with template-based product creation in this specific category.

Simultaneously, I explored relevant Amazon forums and communities where sellers often share their experiences. Here, I discovered that the issue was not isolated and had been reported by other sellers facing similar challenges with the specified template in the designated category. Through collaborative efforts, I gathered more details about the specific nuances of the problem.

One significant insight emerged during this process: certain categories had unique attributes not accurately represented in the template, contributing to errors. To address this, I initiated an educational outreach to sellers, explaining the importance of category-specific attributes and providing guidance on accurately populating the template to align with these nuances.

Result:
Through a combination of hands-on exploration, collaboration with internal teams, insights from an SME, and leveraging information from seller communities, I was able to identify the root cause of the bulk product creation issue linked to the particular template in the specified category. Subsequently, I provided the seller with a comprehensive solution, ensuring that they could proceed with creating bulk products seamlessly in their account while using the designated template.

This experience showcased my commitment to the "Learn and Be Curious" leadership principle by going beyond routine procedures, actively seeking knowledge from various sources, including an SME, and persistently exploring different avenues to understand and address a unique seller issue, particularly when it involved the use of a specific template in a designated category with category-specific attributes.
